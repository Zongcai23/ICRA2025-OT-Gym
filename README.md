Introduction
This project includes the necessary code and simulation environment for bimanual haptic feedback control, RL-based autonomous control, and shared control navigation for cell sorting. To facilitate the demonstration of the visual rendering demo for visitor, I included the "Visualization_rendering_video.zip" contains robot images with different poses and depths for your reference. Following the tutorial, you can replicate the cell sorting demo.

Usage
1. Preparation
Prepare two computers with ROS1 (ROS2 is not supported) for bimanual haptic feedback control. Only one of the computers (main computer) needs Isaac Sim installed to run the RL navigation code.
2. Bimanual Haptic Feedback Control
Download the Bimanual_haptic_feedback_control_code package.
Deploy the Left_hand_geomagic_touch_control and Right_hand_geomagic_touch_control workspaces on the two computers configured with Geomagic Touch devices.
Compile the code and complete the basic setup.
3. RL Navigation Setup
Download the RL_navigation_code and 3DModel packages.
Extract the files and place them in paths without Chinese characters.
Place the RL code in the same directory where Isaac Sim's built-in example standalone code is located. This ensures it has access to the necessary compilation environment for running the code.
Update the file paths in the code where necessary:
DQN_env: Drives the robot for shared control.
deploy_best_model: Drives the robot for full autonomous control.
best_model_750.pth: RL-trained network parameters.
smoothed_path.csv: Stores the optimal path calculated by the A* algorithm.
4. Simulation Environment
Download all files starting with Sim_env and extract them.
Start ROS (roscore) on the laptop.
Open the USD files in Omniverse via ROS1 bridge, and update all referenced USD file paths to avoid errors.
5. Running the Demo
Run the Geomagic Touch code.
Launch the Isaac Sim simulation environment.
Finally, run the RL code.

File Explanation
1. Bimanual_haptic_feedback_control_code.zip
This is the code for controlling the Geomagic Touch. The left-hand and right-hand control codes should be deployed on two separate laptops, and the two folders need to be compiled individually (C++ ROS workspace).
2. RL_navigation_code.zip
Contains the RL-based navigation code for both shared and full autonomous control.
(1). DQN_env: Used for shared control in the simulation environment.
(2). deploy_best_model: Used for fully autonomous control.
(3). best_model_750.pth: The trained RL model with network parameters.
(4). smoothed_path.csv: Stores the optimal path generated by the A* algorithm.
3.3DModel.zip
The USD files contain mechanical structures required for the microfluidic simulation environment, such as those converted from STL files of microfluidic chips and robots.
4.Rendered Images Raw Data.zip
Contains robot rendering images with different poses and depths, used for visual rendering demonstrations.
5.Sim_env_*
Files for setting up the simulation environment in Isaac Sim.
